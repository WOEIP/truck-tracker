        <p>West Oakland is situated adjacent to the Port of Oakland,
          bounded by three major freeways (I-580, I-880, and I-980), and home
          to a major U.S. Postal Service Distribution Center. <b>West Oakland
          residents are exposed to high concentrations of diesel particulate
          matter â€” almost three times higher than the average background levels
          in the Bay Area.</b> Trucks remain the single highest sources of
          diesel emissions in West Oakland. Diesel-powered vehicles and
          equipment account for nearly half of all nitrogen oxides (NOx) and
          more than two-thirds of all particulate matter (PM) emissions from US
          transportation sources. </p>
        <span className="image main"><img src={truck} alt="" /></span>
        <p>Particulate matter or soot is created during the incomplete
          combustion of diesel fuel. Its composition often includes hundreds of
          chemical elements, including sulfates, ammonium, nitrates, elemental
          carbon, condensed organic compounds, and even carcinogenic compounds
          and heavy metals such as arsenic, selenium, cadmium and zinc. Though
          just a fraction of the width of a human hair, particulate matter
          varies in size from coarse particulates (less than 10 microns in
          diameter) to fine particulates (less than 2.5 microns) to ultrafine
          particulates (less than 0.1 microns). Ultrafine particulates, which
          are small enough to penetrate the cells of the lungs, make up 80-95%
          of diesel soot pollution. </p>
        <p>Diesel exhaust has been classified a potential human carcinogen by
          the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the International
          Agency for Researchd on Cancer. Exposure to high levels of diesel
          exhaust has been shown to cause lung tumors in rats, and studies of
          humans routinely exposed to diesel fumes indicate a greater risk of
          lung cancer. For example, occupational health studies of railroad,
          dock, trucking, and bus garage workers exposed to high levels of
          diesel exhaust over many years consistently demonstrate a 20 to 50
          percent increase in the risk of lung cancer or mortality.</p>

        <p><b>Our project intention is to empower all communities that suffer
          the impacts of trucking and the freight industry.</b> Our truck
          traffic survey tool allows community residents to document truck
          traffic volumes and directions, and maps that data for later analysis
          and advocacy. Our mission is to give residents the tools and the power
          to get toxic truck emission off of their streets and out of their
          neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>The tools we create can be used to survey surface streets for
          estimated traffic volumes and routes of medium duty and heavy duty
          trucks along residential streets in West Oakland in order to improve
          the spatial representation of roadway emissions and differentiate the
          contribution of Port versus non-Port trucks. This data will aid
          residents who advocate for the control of medium heavy-duty (MHD) and
          heavy heavy-duty (HHD) truck traffic on residential streets of West
          Oakland, enforce legal truck routes, identify the locations and
          duration of truck idling activity, and reduce the vehicle miles
          travelled for trucks within the study area.</p>
